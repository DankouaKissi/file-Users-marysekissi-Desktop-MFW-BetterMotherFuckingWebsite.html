		<h1> This is <EM>still</EM> a motherfucking website.</h1>
		<ASIDE>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</ASIDE>
	</header>

	<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>

	<p><STRONG>7 fucking declarations.</STRONG></p>

	<P>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="file:///Users/marysekissi/Desktop/MFW/Motherfuckingwebsite.html"> </a>
	into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</P>

	<UL>
		<LI>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</LI>
		<LI><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</LI>
		<LI><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</LI>
		<LI>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</LI>
		<LI>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</LI>
	</UL>

	<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

	<P>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</P>

	<P>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</P>

	<h2>A little less contrast</h2>

	<P>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</P>

	<h2>Size Matters</h2>

	<P>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</P>

	<h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

	<P>I love what the creator of <a href="file:///Users/marysekissi/Desktop/MFW/Motherfuckingwebsite.html">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</P>
